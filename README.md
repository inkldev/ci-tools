## 🧑‍💻 Development info

This Node.js project is configured to use [Typescript], which brings compile-time type-safety.

Furthermore, this project uses [yarn] for package management.

Finally, [pkg] is used to bundle the project into a single self-contained executable binary. The [Typescript] transpilation module format is set to CommonJS since the [pkg] bundler does not fully support ESM yet.

### ⚙ Prerequisites
- [x] [Node.js] v16
- [x] [yarn] v1

### 📃 Scripts

- To download all required dependencies, simply run
  ```shell
  yarn install
  ```

- During development of this project, it is useful to enable automatic [Typescript] compilation on source changes, which can be done via the following command
  ```shell
  yarn run dev
  ```

- To execute the project, simply run
  ```shell
  yarn run main --help
  ```

- To generate a build optimized for production, execute
  ```shell
  yarn run build
  ```
  which will emit the executable at `bin/ci-tools`
