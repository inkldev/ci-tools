Then, in CI environment execute the following command:
```shell
curl https://api.github.com/repos/inkldev/ci-tools/contents/install.sh -H "Authorization: token $CI_TOOLS_TOKEN" -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v4.raw' -sL | bash
```

Upon successful installation you should see:
```
-- ci-tools vX.Y.Z is now installed
-- All Done!
```

## ‚ö° Usage

### ‚è´ Bump version code
```shell
ci-tools bump_version_code \
  --gradle_file=app/build.gradle \
  --service_account=service_account.json \
  --project_number=1234567890 \
  --app_id=1:1234567890:android:01234567890abcdef

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development info

This Node.js project is configured to use [Typescript], which brings compile-time type-safety.

Furthermore, this project uses [yarn] for package management.

Finally, [pkg] is used to bundle the project into a single self-contained executable binary. The [Typescript] transpilation module format is set to CommonJS since the [pkg] bundler does not fully support ESM yet.

### ‚öô Prerequisites
- [x] [Node.js] v16
- [x] [yarn] v1

### üìÉ Scripts

- To download all required dependencies, simply run
  ```shell
  yarn install
  ```

- During development of this project, it is useful to enable automatic [Typescript] compilation on source changes, which can be done via the following command
  ```shell
  yarn run dev
  ```

- To execute the project, simply run
  ```shell
  yarn run main --help
  ```

- To generate a build optimized for production, execute
  ```shell
  yarn run build
  ```
  which will emit the executable at `bin/ci-tools`
